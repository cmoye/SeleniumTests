| user | ensure | existence of text| Meanwhile, I've been wondering about the feasibility of harvesting only pine beetle damaged trees - and using wild growing invasive species to make bio fuel..... Kudzu, Asian Privet, and the blight of Ailanthus altissima (Tree-of-Heaven). I used to live on old farm land INFESTED with all of it and came to understand just how pervasive, aggressive and insidious these alien species are. Truly Satan's botanical minions. So if devouring them as biofuel worked out, we'd get fuel AND restore landscapes to their original glory. It seems so logical -- a Win Win!! |
